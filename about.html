  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a dynamic individual with a unique blend of creativity, technical skill, and social intelligence. I'm extroverted nature allows me to thrive in social settings, where I likely enjoy making connections and learning from others. My curiosity about what people are thinking suggests a deep empathy and desire to understand human behavior, which probably makes me a great conversationalist and listener as well as an observer.</p>

  <p>My artistic side, with singing, dancing, and oil pastel drawing, highlights my ability to express emotions and thoughts in different forms. This creative outlet is balanced by my technical proficiency in full stack web development, where my logical thinking and problem-solving abilities come into play.</p>

    <p>Moreover, my preference for neatness shows I'm disciplined, organized, and enjoy maintaining control over my environment, allowing me to be efficient in both my personal and professional life. Altogether, I seem like someone who is both fun and thoughtful, capable of bringing energy into social situations while also having the discipline to pursue deeper learning and technical projects.</p>
